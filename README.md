# Breakout
I made breakout game after following [a tutorial here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games) and suped it up with some keyboard specials. To give myself and other people practice doing pushes, pulls, and pull requests on github, I decided to give it a repo.(http://www.sirrineprogramming.com/games/breakout.html).
# Contributing
Looking for any sort of contribution. 

 - CSS theme
 - Different HTML layout
 - More special moves using different keypresses.
 - Different sounds
 - Documentation
 - Better comments to explain the code to newbies
 - If you want to reorganize the existing code 
 - Anything else just go ahead and code it
 - Or open up an issue
 Hope you enjoy playing the game and the chance to practice building it up.
