# Breakout
I made breakout game after following [a tutorial here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games) and suped it up with some keyboard specials.

# Contributing
Looking for any sort of contribution. 

 - CSS theme
 - Different HTML layout
 - More special moves using different keypresses.
 - Different sounds
 - Documentation
 - Better comments to explain the code
 
 Hope you enjoy playing the game and the chance to practice building it up.
